# Code Explanation
## Packages
Pandas : pandas provides data structures like DataFrame, which makes easy to handle and preprocess datasets, load data from various formats, and perform data cleaning operations.  
train_test_split: To divide the data into training and testing sets. This helps in training the model on one part of the data and testing it on another to check its performance.  
LogisticRegression: It is a simple and commonly used algorithm for binary classification problems, such as predicting whether a passenger survived or not on the Titanic.  
StandardScaler: Scaling features to have zero mean and unit variance is important for many machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, to perform optimally.  
SimpleImputer: Real-world datasets often contain missing values, and SimpleImputer provides strategies to fill in these missing values, ensuring that the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.  
Numpy: It is used for array manipulations and numerical computations, such as combining preprocessed numerical and categorical features into a single array before training the model.  


## Loading and Preprocessing Data  
Load the Titanic dataset from a CSV file. Drop columns that are not necessary for the prediction.  

## Defining Features and Target  
X contains the feature columns (all columns except 'Survived').  
y contains the target column ('Survived').  

## Preprocessing Numerical Features  
numerical_features specifies the numerical columns.  
SimpleImputer fills missing values in numerical columns with the mean.  
StandardScaler scales numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance.  
X_num contains the imputed and scaled numerical features.  


## Preprocessing Categorical Features  
categorical_features specifies the categorical columns.  
X_cat contains the categorical features.  
Encodes the 'Sex' column: male as 0 and female as 1.  
Encodes the 'Embarked' column: 'C' as 0, 'Q' as 1, and 'S' as 2.  
Encodes the 'Pclass' column by subtracting 1 to make it 0-indexed.  
SimpleImputer fills missing values in categorical columns with the most frequent value.  
X_cat contains the imputed categorical features.  


## Combining Preprocessed Features  
Combine the preprocessed numerical and categorical features into a single array X_preprocessed.  


## Splitting the Data  
Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.  

## Training the Logistic Regression Model  
Initialize a Logistic Regression model with a maximum of 200 iterations.  
Train the model using the training data.  

## Making Predictions and Evaluating the Model  
Make predictions on the test set.  
Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set and prints the accuracy score.  
##  Predicting Survival for User Input  
Define a function predict_survival that takes user input for passenger details, preprocesses the input, and uses the trained model to predict if the passenger would have survived.  
Preprocesse the input similar to the training data.  
Make a prediction and prints the result.  
Call the predict_survival function to take user input and predict survival.
